# PBridgesAssignment
 EGM722 Project

Steps required to obtain the code and be able to utilise it for your own projects.

1. Getting started
To get started with the exercises, you'll need to install both git and conda on your computer. 

2. Download/clone this repository
Once you have these installed, clone this repository to your computer by doing one of the following things:

Open GitHub Desktop and select File > Clone Repository. Select the URL tab, then enter the URL for this repository.
Open Git Bash (from the Start menu), then navigate to your folder for this module. Now, execute the following command: git clone https://github.com/pjb41/PBridgesAssignment.git. You should see some messages about downloading/unpacking files, and the repository should be set up.
You can also clone this repository by clicking the green "clone or download" button above, and select "download ZIP" at the bottom of the menu. Once it's downloaded, unzip the file and move on to the next step.

Create a conda environment
Once you have successfully cloned the repository, you can then create a conda environment to work through the exercises.

To do this, use the environment.yml file provided in the repository. If you have Anaconda Navigator installed, you can do this by selecting Import from the bottom of the Environments panel.

Otherwise, you can open a command prompt (on Windows, you may need to select an Anaconda command prompt). Navigate to the folder where you cloned this repository and run the following command:

C:\Users\pjb41\PBridgesAssignment conda env create -f environment.yml
